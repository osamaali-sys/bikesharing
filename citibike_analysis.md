New York Boasted 65.2 Million visitors in 2019 from all over the world according to New York Times post (https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/16/nyregion/nyc-tourism-record.html.) MasterCard also ranked New York at number 6 of cities most visited by tourists. This has a major impact on the bikesharing business, as the autmobile traffic grows, bikes will become increasingly popular to maneauver around the city. Currently there are  'six thousand bikes at more than three hundred stations in New York City' (https://chi.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/03/Bikeshare_TRB_submission.pdf)

Even though Des Moines has a smaller residential population, their visitor count is at 13.7 million per year according to a survey in 2016 by Catch Des Moines (https://www.catchdesmoines.com/articles/post/des-moines-draws-record-number-of-visitors-to-region/) which is no small feat. Annually there is a projected growth to the visitor count, and with lack of bikesharing competition it might be worth investigating investment potential.
